## Configuration

This extension requires an OpenAI API key to function. Here's how to set it up:

1. Navigate to the [OpenAI website](https://www.openai.com/) and create an account if you don't have one already.
2. Once you're logged in, go to the API section and generate a new API key [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
3. Click on the extension icon in your Chrome browser and paste your API key into the text field, then click "Save".

Your extension is now ready to use! Simply select some text on a webpage, right-click, and choose "Summarize with ChatGPT" to see a summary of the selected text.

## Security

Please note that your OpenAI API key is sensitive information and should be kept secure. This extension stores your API key in Chrome's local storage, which is not accessible by other extensions or webpages. 

## Rate Limiting

Please be aware that making too many requests to the OpenAI API in a short period of time can lead to your API key being rate-limited. If you encounter this issue, you may need to wait a while before you can make more requests.
