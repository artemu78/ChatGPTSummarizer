## Security

Please note that your OpenAI API key is sensitive information and should be kept secure. This extension stores your API key in Chrome's local storage, which is not accessible by other extensions or webpages. 

## Rate Limiting

Please be aware that making too many requests to the OpenAI API in a short period of time can lead to your API key being rate-limited. If you encounter this issue, you may need to wait a while before you can make more requests.
